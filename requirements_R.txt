# R Dependencies for Crossed vs Nested Random Effects Models
#
# Install these packages in R using:
# install.packages(c("lme4", "ggplot2", "dplyr", "tidyr", "broom.mixed", "lattice", "gridExtra", "sjPlot", "performance"))

# Core mixed effects modeling
lme4        # Linear mixed-effects models using Eigen and S4

# Data manipulation and visualization  
ggplot2     # Grammar of graphics plotting
dplyr       # Data manipulation grammar
tidyr       # Tidy data principles
gridExtra   # Arranging plots

# Model diagnostics and output
broom.mixed # Tidy model outputs for mixed models
sjPlot      # Plotting and table functions for mixed models
performance # Model performance and diagnostics
lattice     # Additional plotting functions

# Optional advanced packages:
# brms        # Bayesian mixed models
# glmmTMB     # Generalized linear mixed models with various extensions
# MCMCglmm    # MCMC-based mixed models
# nlme        # Alternative mixed models package
# emmeans     # Estimated marginal means
# lmerTest    # Tests for mixed models

# For Jupyter notebook with R kernel:
# IRkernel    # R kernel for Jupyter (install via: devtools::install_github("IRkernel/IRkernel"))
